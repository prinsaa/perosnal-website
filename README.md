# personal-website

I chose to exclusively utilize HTML and CSS in crafting my website due to a deliberate emphasis on simplicity, performance, and control over the design process. By forgoing the use of more complex frameworks or languages, I aimed to streamline the development process and maintain a lightweight, fast-loading website.

This approach allows for a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of web development, promotes clean code practices, and ensures a level of control that facilitates a customized and unique design. Furthermore, the decision aligns with my commitment to continuous learning, enabling me to sharpen my skills in core web technologies.

**Notes:**

The following repo was used to connected my form to my google sheets: https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets

The website is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience regardless of the electronic device used.
